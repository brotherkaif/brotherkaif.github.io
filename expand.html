                    <p>Kaif Ahmed is a person who looks after all the hard drives in a datacenter (you know, where the clouds are). He has been working in the IT industry (to be totally honest with you, he kind of got into it by accident) since 2014. During that time, he has worked at a number of organisations, big and small. If you're interested in the career side of things, then I suggest you check out his LinkedIn Profile and see his previous experience. You may notice that Kaif hasn't always worked in IT. In fact, before this he was working as a Video Editor and Camera Operator. You might be thinking "that's quite a big change of industry!" (or not) but, suprisingly, there was a lot of overlap. There's even some of his old video work at his BeHance profile if you're curious. He is currently living in London, I say currently because for three years he was living in beautiful sunny Cape Town, South Africa (I'm sure he misses the weather in hindsight). He has a number of hobbies. Like gaming, where he mostly plays strange little indie on Steam (here's his Steam profile btw, you know, in case you wanted to trade cards) or, being the die-hard Nintendo fan he is, on his Nintendo Switch (here's his Nintendo profile btw, I guess you could shoot him over a friend request). He enjoys exploring London and documenting (well, taking photos at least) his travels on his Instagram profile. He very occasionally writes (and it is quite a random set of topics) on his blog. He's pretty geeky, his social network of choice isn't Twitter (although he does have a Twitter profile), or Facebook (he has a Facebook profile btw), but rather on the really geeky corners (like freenode) of IRC! (Yeah, like, the chat program released in 1988, what a techno-hipster). He also like cats, because, of course he does.

If not, you might as well go and check some other part of the internet out, life's too short to be expanding a page full of links.</p>
