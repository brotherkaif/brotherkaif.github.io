			expandedTextArray[0] = "Kaif Ahmed is a Storage Engineer looking after storage arrays, fibre channel based SANs and working with cloud platforms. He has been working in the IT industry (to be totally honest with you, he kind of got into it by accident) since 2014. During that time, he has worked at a number of organisations, big and small. If you're interested in the career side of things, you might want to check out his {LinkedIn profile} and see his previous experience. You may notice that Kaif hasn't always worked in IT. In fact, before this he spent nearly 10 years in video production working in various roles such as a Video Editor (stringing a narrative together from nonlinear clips), Camera Operator (looking at things from a slightly different of point of view), VFX Assistant (setting things up for people) and even a Runner (delivering tapes by hand around London). He's worked on a lot of video projects that you can see at his {Behance profile} if you're curious. Whilst this may seem like a big career change, there was a lot of overlap. You see, after a while, Kaif realised that he was more interested in the computer systems that run everything in the background.";
	        expandedTextArray[1] = "He is currently based in London, I say currently because for three years he was living in beautiful sunny Cape Town, South Africa (I'm sure he misses the weather in hindsight). He was fortunate enough to be able to take an epic road trip around the country, which he and his wife blogged about in their {travel blog}. Right now, he's back in his hometown of London, a city that he finds fascinating enough to want to explore and take pictures to put it up on his {Instagram profile}. He also lives on the internet (don't we all), where he has a fairly infrequently updated blog, although the topics are quite random. I guess that's also a good description for this site, which took ages to put together. Both writing in the 3rd person (which will send you mad after a while) and attempting to code this (he's definitely not a web designer!) this must have seemed like a good idea at the time but ultimately proved quite challenging. At least he had fun working on it!";
            expandedTextArray[2] = "Things like gaming, where he mostly plays strange little indie games on Steam (here's his Steam profile btw, you know, in case you wanted to trade cards or something) or, being the die-hard Nintendo fan he is, on his Nintendo Switch (here's his Nintendo profile btw, I guess you could shoot him over a friend request). Other geeky hobbies, you know, that type of person... the kind of person who likes to hang around the more tech-focused corners (like freenode) of IRC and uses Linux for fun. In fact he loves using the terminal over the GUI (although he might just be a techno-hipster that likes using non-mainstream tools). He even has a {Github profile} (even though he isn't really a programmer). He also likes cats, because... of course he does.
